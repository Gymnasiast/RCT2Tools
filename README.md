# RCT2 Content Browser

* Author: Robert Jordan
* Version: v1.1.0.1

RCT2 Content Browser is a more advanced program originally designed to replace DatChecker.
With this you can easily browse and manage all content in your RCT2 directory.
RCT2CB not only shows you a visual representation of the object, but all of it's information and data as well.
This makes the tool useful for Studying RCT2 file types as well.
All variables and flags listed in the info tab have information on them in the source code.
Please note that not all objects are 100% accurately displayed in the view window.

## Requirements

Works with Windows 7, Windows 8 has not been tested.

Your DPI setting must be at 100% percent, otherwise the scan button won't be visible.

**Dialog Checkbox:** Changes the view to dialog view.

**Image Checkbox:** Changes the view to individual images in the file.

**Drag Object from List:** Allows you to copy the object and place it in the dropped location.

## Settings

**Default Directory:** The default directory to use for RCT2 data. Make sure to use the ObjData folder.

**Objects Per Tick:** Changes how many objects are loaded inbetween pauses. More objects will make the program run slower until fully loaded and less objects will make the loading take longer.

**Quick Load Attractions:** Only allows attractions to load 35 images. This is useful when browsing attractions as many of them can have thousands of images, which takes awhile to load.

**Save:** Saves the settings to *Settings.xml*.
